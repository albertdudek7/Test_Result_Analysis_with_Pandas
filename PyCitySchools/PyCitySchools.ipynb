    "- Summary of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "On Average, Charter schools have a higher average math and reading score (83% to 76%, 83% to 80% respectively. Additionally, the overall passing rate for is much higher for Charter schools 90% to 53%. \n",
    "Larger school sizes (2000 to 5000 students) have a much lower passing rate than school sizes between 0-1000 students and 1000-2000 students. \n",
    "Schools with the highest overall passing rates over 90% were: Cabrera High School, Griffin High School, Pena High School, Thomas High School, Wilson High School and Wright High School. \n",
    "Math and Reading scores by grade did not fluctuate greatly per each school. \n",
    "Each of the top 5 performing schools were Charters and each of the bottom 5 performing schools were District schools.\n",
    "To summarize, Charter schools greatly outperformed District schools and larger school sizes had a lower passing rate than smaller schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-Conclusions of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Conclusions from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the summary of the analysis, Charter schools greatly outperformed District Schools and schools with a larger size performed worse than schools with small to moderate sizes. \n",
    "The Average Math score for Charter schools was 83% compared to 76% for District, and the reading scores were 83% to the districtâ€™s 80%. The great disparity comes in the % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing.\n",
    "For Charter schools: 93% of students passed Math, 96% passed reading and 90% of students passed both Math and Reading. Compared to the District school performance where 66% of students passed Math, 80% passed Reading and only 53% students had an overall passing score. \n",
    "The difference between overall passing percentage between Charter and District was significant, nearly 40% more students passed in Charter schools (roughly 37% more).\n",
    "Additionally, there was a significant difference in the overall passing percentage between school sizes. Large schools (2000 to 5000 students) saw an overall passing percentage of 58% compared to 89% and 90% for schools with a size of 0-1000 students and 1000-2000 students respectively. The greatest disparity was in Math specifically. Only 69% of students passed Math in large schools where 93% of students passed Math in small to moderate sized schools. The Reading passing percentage in larger schools was better compared to the Math passing percentage: 82% to 69% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Charter schools greatly outperformed District schools in the percentage of their students passing. While small to moderate sized schools greatly outperformed schools with 2000-5000 students. Maybe a student to teacher ratio is smaller in the moderate to small sized schools allowing students more time with teachers. That is only an assumption though. \n"
